Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
     an inline element does not cause a line break (start on a new line) and does not take up the full width of a page, 
     only the space bounded by its opening and closing tag. It is usually used within other HTML elements.
     Other examples of inline elements are: anchor <a> tag, image <img> tag
 
     A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width of a page, from left to right.
     A block-level element can take up one line or multiple lines and has a line break before and after the element.
     examples of the block-level tag are:  Heading tags <h1> to <h6>

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
     An absolutely positioned element is an element whose computed position value is absolute or fixed. The top, right,
     bottom, and left properties specify offsets from the edges of the element's containing block. (The containing block
     is the ancestor relative to which the element is positioned.) If the element has margins, they are added to the offset.
     The element establishes a new block formatting context (BFC) for its contents.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
     Using width, max-width and margin: auto;

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    display inline by default : <div> defaults to block, <a> element (or anchor element)
    diplay block by default   : <img> tag 
 
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
      The box model is the groupe of box (Margin, border, padding) wich wraps around every html element which can be changed 
      to make up the style of that element as needed.
